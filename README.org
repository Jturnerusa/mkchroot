* mkchroot
A utility to make chroots that are tightly integrated with the host system, similar
to distrobox.

* Differences from distrobox
~mkchroot~ does not use podman or any container management software. Instead it uses ~bwrap~
directly to create the "container".

~mkchroot~ also currently requires running as root, to avoid dealing with userns mapping issues.

A lot of features of distrobox are probably not yet implemented, and this is very much a work in progress that I will work on as I or others use it.
